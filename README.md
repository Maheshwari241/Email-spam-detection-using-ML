# Email-spam-detection-using-ML
For the purposes of to optimize email security and the user experience, unwanted, potentially dangerous emails are extracted from effective ones using a process defined as email spam detection. By accurately filtering spam emails, this project presents a sophisticated email spam detection system that optimizes the protection for online communication. To ensure to transform text input into numeric forms that machine learning algorithms can process efficiently, the system utilizes Count Vectorizer to preprocess and examine the text of messages from a labelled dataset of emails. The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of several models including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting etc were evaluated with the aim to choose the best strategy. Once the vectorizer and finalized model were integrated into a Streamlit web application, users could enter email data and get predictions about whether it was spam or not instantaneously. This user-friendly application offers a scalable solution that can be adjusted to various situations and a useful interface for daily usage. The technique takes into consideration today's email security requirements while establishing the requirements for future developments like real-time processing and feedback integration. All things considered, this project supports a more secure email environment by providing a user-friendly and flexible solution for efficient spam identification.
